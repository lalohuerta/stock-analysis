# Challenge 02
# Green Stock Analysis 
## Project Overview

Steve has asked me to help him run an stock analysis for his parents so they can make the right decision in investment. With all the dataset given I ran a previous analysis finding daily volume and yearly return for only one company DQ nevertheless Steve and his parents want to analyse 11 more companies and compared them.

## Purpose

To make a more efficient code by refactoring so this code will work faster if Steve and his parents want to analyse more companies.

## Results
 
Four different arrays were created to switch the nesting order for all the "for" loops. 

 * tickers
 * tickersVolumes
 * tickersStartingPrices
 * tickersEndingPrices

I created a variable called "tickerIndex" so I can match all the arrays created and iterates through the dataset. With this functions the code ran faster than before and as we added less variables it is using less memory.
