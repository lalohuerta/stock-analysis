# Challenge 02
# Green Stock Analysis 
## Project Overview

Steve has asked me to help him run an stock analysis for his parents so they can make the right decision in investment. With all the dataset given I ran a previous analysis finding daily volume and yearly return for only one company DQ nevertheless Steve and his parents want to analyse 11 more companies and compared them.

## Purpose

To make a more efficient code by refactoring so this code will work faster if Steve and his parents want to analyse more companies.

## Results
